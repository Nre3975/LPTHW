# Exercise 11: Asking Questions 

# Get data IN to program. 
# Most Software: Takes input, Computational work on it, give output. 
# Input: Get input from the user, with a prompt. 

print("How old are you?", end= ' ')
age = input() 
print("How tall are you>", end= ' ')
height = input()
print("How much do you weigh", end = ' ')
weight = input() 

print(f"So, you're {age} old, {height} tall and {weight} heavy.")
